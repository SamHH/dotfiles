# xmonad-samhh

Provided the `~/.xmonad/build` file is set up correctly, this directory will be used to build when calling `xmonad --recompile`, and its output will be used when calling `xmonad --restart`. No further configuration should be required (besides setting up Cabal as in any other Haskell project).
